changes:
  - bugfix: "Xenomorph restrictions on items they can pick up have had their determining logic made more _robust_."
  - code_imp: "The itempicky component (restricts what can be picked up via a whitelist) can now, optionally, have a callback fed to it to determine cases of bypassing that whitelist."
